  <p><em>PSST... <br>Check out my work on this challenge <br>by opening the Console in your browser!</p>
  <p> You can go to it by typing </em><br><code> CMD + OPTION + J </code></em> <br>See you there! üíÅ</em></p>

<script>
    // start with strings, numbers and booleans (PRIMITIVE)
    console.group("Primitive Values")
    console.info("Strings, Numbers, Booleans, Undefined and Null are Primitive values.")
    console.log("this means, we're setting a direct value to a variable")
    let myName = "kara";
    console.log("myName is: "+ myName)

    let yourName = myName;
    console.log("yourName is: "+ yourName)

    console.log("if I change the value held at myName, yourName will not change")

    myName = "Sarah";
    console.log("yourName is: " + yourName + " and myName is: " + myName )
    console.groupEnd();

    console.group("Reference Values")
    // Let's say we have an array
    console.log("If we have a players Array")
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
