## Challenges

### Day O1 - [Drum Kit](challenge1.html)
#### Things I learned:
  - kbd HTML Element - The kbd element typically represents keyboard input, though it may also represent other input, such as voice commands. [reference](https://w3c.github.io/html-reference/kbd.html#kbd)
  - Data HTML Attribute - To allow for developers to assign custom attributes to elements and having convention, the "data-*" attribute was created, and used in this instance, to refer to the key codes.[reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/data-*)
  - Audio HTML Element - This element represents audio data to the DOM. In this case, it is referring to the various instrument sounds to be played.
